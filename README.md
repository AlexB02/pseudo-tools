# The Pseudo Tools Project
A compiler and emulator for pseudocode sources.

## Overview
The pseudo-tools project is an open source collection of programs to assist in the teaching of pseudocode to students.
The goal is to enable students to learn pseudocode to their A-Level exam board specification, ensuring success in exams and beyond.

After tutoring A-Level computer science, we found that schools aren't doing enough to teach students the pseudocode syntax that
they will be assessed on, which in turn makes even the highest achieving students stressed, as they are unsure of how to exactly piece together an exam solution.

We hope the project will enable students to learn and evolve their programming skills, whilest also familiarising themselves with the exact style required for their exam.

## Toolset

1. A bytecode emulator.
2. A pseudocode compiler accepting sources based on the OCR, AQA and Cambridge International A Level and GCSE specifications.

## Roadmap

1. Designing a bytecode language to represent compiled pseudocode.
2. Implementing an emulator for bytecode sources. Release v0.1.0.
3. Developing a language specification for A-Level pseudocode for multiple exam boards.
4. Developing the front-end of the pseudocode compiler. Release v0.2.0.
5. Developing the backend of the pseudocode compiler. Release v0.3.0.
6. Release v1.0.0.
